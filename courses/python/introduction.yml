      This tutorial is intended to serve as a demonstration of what's possible with this program.
  - subtitle: Print statements
    content: |
      Whenever people learn a new programming language they tend to start by learning how to print `Hello World`.
      So that's what we're going to do now.
      Type out this code and run it.
      ```python
      print("Hello world")
      ```

      ## Challenge
      Now that you can print `Hello World`, change it to say `Hello {your name here}`
      (be sure to replace `{your_name_here}` with your name).
  - subtitle: Variables
    content: |
      Variables are how we give names to data.
      ```python
      # Set my variable to "world" (notice the quotes ")
      my_variable = "world"
      # Print Hello {my_variable}
      print("Hello " + my_variable)
      ```
      There's quite a lot going on here so let's break it down.

      See those lines that start with `#`? Anything after that python ignores.
      This is really useful for making *comments* about our code since we can type
      anything we want there.

      Next we have the quotation marks around `world`. This is because `"` says
      that there is a **string** inside. A string is just a fancy way of saying text.

      In this example we called our variable `my_variable`, but we could have called it anything.
      As long as the variable starts with a letter or character and has no spaces its name will work.

      Type out this example and see what happens.

      ## Challenge

      Create a variable called `my_name` and like above make a print statement to say `Hello {my_name}`.
  - subtitle: Input
    content: |
      So far we have to manually put our name into the code.

      Let's say that you want to give this program to your friends, right now
      you would have to manually change the name each time.
      What about if we could ask for their name when they run the program?

      ```python
      name = input("What is your name?")
      print("Hello " + name)
      ```
