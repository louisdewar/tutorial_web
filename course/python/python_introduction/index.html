  <h2 class="subtitle">2. Print statements</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>Whenever people learn a new programming language they tend to start by learning how to print <code>Hello World</code>.
So that's what we're going to do now.
Type out this code and run it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;Hello world&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>Now that you can print <code>Hello World</code>, change it to say <code>Hello {your name here}</code>
(be sure to replace <code>{your_name_here}</code> with your name).</p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">3. Variables</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>Variables are how we give names to data.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Set my variable to &quot;world&quot; (notice the quotes &quot;)
my_variable = &quot;world&quot;
# Print Hello {my_variable}
print(&quot;Hello &quot; + my_variable)
</code></pre>
<p>There's quite a lot going on here so let's break it down.</p>
<p>See those lines that start with <code>#</code>? Anything after that python ignores.
This is really useful for making <em>comments</em> about our code since we can type
anything we want there.</p>
<p>Next we have the quotation marks around <code>world</code>. This is because <code>&quot;</code> says
that there is a <strong>string</strong> inside. A string is just a fancy way of saying text.</p>
<p>In this example we called our variable <code>my_variable</code>, but we could have called it anything.
As long as the variable starts with a letter or character and has no spaces its name will work.</p>
<p>Type out this example and see what happens.</p>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>Create a variable called <code>my_name</code> and like above make a print statement to say <code>Hello {my_name}</code>.</p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">4. Input</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>So far we have to manually put our name into the code.</p>
<p>Let's say that you want to give this program to your friends, right now
you would have to manually change the name each time.
What about if we could ask for their name when they run the program?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">name = input(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)
print(&quot;Hello &quot; + name)
</code></pre>
