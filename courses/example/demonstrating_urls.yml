  - subtitle: How urls are processed on the server
    content: |
      On the **server** a scan is done at the start for all courses.
      It then saves the url field and serves the file under `{course_group}/{url}/index.html`.
      If the url field is changed after the server is running it will not be updated,
      but if any content of a course is changed it will be updated on a browser refresh.
  - subtitle: How urls are processed during building
    content: |
      It is much like the server in the fact that the file name is irrelevent.
  - subtitle: How are assets handled?
    content: |
      Since you only ever reference assets by relative paths it shouldn't matter,
      but if you want to know the folder structure is like this:
      `{url}`:
        - `index.html`
        - `assets/{all the files that used to be in the folder named with the same name as this file (excluding the .yml)}`

      Notice how [this link](assets/dog.png) magically works despite the different url name.
  - subtitle: An aside about numbering
    show_number: true
    content: |
      This course has the following global (within the course) tutorial settings:

      ```
      tutorial_settings:
        show_number: false
      ```

      This causes the numbers to not be visible in any tutorial except this one has the setting (locally):

      ```
      show_number: true
      ```
