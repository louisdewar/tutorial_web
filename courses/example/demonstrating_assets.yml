  - subtitle: How assets are found
    content: |
      When you create assets for a project you simply create a folder with the **same** name
      as the name of the course (excluding `.yml`) and when the project is built
      the assets will be placed in a directory `assets` relative to the location of the course.
      What this means is that you can access any asset using the address `./assets/ASSET_NAME`.

      Here is a [link to the asset](assets/dog.png).

  - subtitle: An aside about hiding tutorial numbers
    show_number: false
    content: |
      Unless you explicitally add a course wide setting to disable them, tutorial numbers are shown
      by default.
      This tutorial has a local setting of `show_number: false` hence it isn't visible.
