    content: |
      When you create assets for a project you simply create a folder with the **same** name
      as the name of the course (excluding `.yml`) and when the project is built
      the assets will be placed in a directory `assets` relative to the location of the course.
      What this means is that you can access any asset using the address `./assets/ASSET_NAME`.
